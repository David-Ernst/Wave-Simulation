# Welcome to WaveGrid!


Within this simulation of physical waves, a particle field extends across the x1-x2 plane, responding dynamically to the introduction of waves that can be incorporated into the simulation.
You can find the executable **download** [**here**](https://github.com/David-Ernst/WaveGrid/releases/tag/v2.0).
**Please note** that if you wish to use the code, Processing 4.3 has been used.

## Controls
- Use your **Mouse** to look around
 - Use the **w, s, a and d** key to move your camera **forward
, backward, left and right**
- Use the **Space Bar and the Shift key** to go **up or down**
- Press **p** to **pause** the simulation
- Press **r** to **reset** the simulations time
- Press **ESC** to **pause the simulation and free your mouse** so you can edit the simulation

## Edit The Simulation

Under **Open Wave List** you can add, edit and delete waves by the following parameters:

 - **x1-Coordinate** in meters (x1 ∈ ℝ)
 - **x2-Coordinate** in meters  (x2 ∈ ℝ)
 - **ŝ** the **maximum amplitude** in meters
 - **λ** the **wavelength** in meters
 - **c** the **velocity of the wave** in meters per second
 - **start time** the time after the start of the simulation at which the wave begins
 - **ϕ** the **phase constant** in radians per meter

**Please note that the simulation begins at x1 = 0 m and x2 = 0 m where x1 ∈ ℝ⁺ and x2 ∈ ℝ⁺.**

Under **Edit Sandbox** you can edit the following properties of your particle field:

 - the **x1-length** of your particle field in meters
 - the **x2-length** of your particle field in meters
 - the **density** of your particle field in particles per meter
 - the **resolution** of your simulation in pixel per meter
