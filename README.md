# Welcome to David Ernst's Wave Simulation!


Within this simulation of physical waves, a particle field extends across the x1-x2 plane, responding dynamically to the introduction of waves that can be incorporated into the simulation.
**Please note** that JDK 11 or newer must be installed on the PC in order for it to work also if you wish to use the code please note that Processing 4 or newer must be used.

## Controls

 - Use the **w, s, a and d** key to move your camera **forward
, backward, left and right**
- Use the **Space Bar and the Shift key** to go **up or down**
- Press **p** to **pause** the simulation
- Press **r** to **reset** the simulation
- Press **ESC** to **pause the simulation and free your mouse** so you can edit the simulation

## Edit The Simulation

Under **Open Wave List** you can add, edit and delete waves by the following parameters:

 - **x-Coordinate** in meters
 - **y-Coordinate** in meters
 - **ŝ** the **maximum amplitude** in meters
 - **λ** the **wavelength** in meters
 - **c** the **velocity of the wave** in meters per second
 - **start time** the time after the start of the simulation at which the wave shall start
 - **ϕ** the **phase constant** in radians per meter

**Please note that the simulation begins at x = 0m and y = 0m where x ∈ R+ and y ∈ R+**

Under **Edit Sandbox** you can edit the following properties of your particle field:

 - the **width** of your particle field in meters
 - the **height** of your particle field in meters
 - the **density** of your particle field in particles per meter
 - the **resolution** of your simulation in pixel per meter
